# Fibonacci Series

The Fibonacci Series is a sequence which always starts with zero and one. 
It then continues by adding the previous two numbers in the sequences.

For example, the first ten values in the Fibonacci Series are as follows:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34

The equations for the sequence are:
 - F(0) = 0
 - F(1) = 1
 - F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)
