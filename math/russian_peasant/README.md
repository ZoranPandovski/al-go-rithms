### Russian Peasant
Given two integers, write a function to multiply them without using multiplication operator. The idea is to double the first number and halve the second number repeatedly till the second number doesnâ€™t become 1. In the process, whenever the second number become odd, we add the first number to result (result is initialized as 0)
