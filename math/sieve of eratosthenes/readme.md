The 'Sieve of Eratosthenes' is a simple method used to find prime numbers.

1 must be left out from this as it is a factor of every number.
So take 2 as prime number.
Then cross of all the integers that are a mutiple of 2.
Then move to the next number that has not been crossed out - 3
Then cross of all the integers thata re a multiple of 3.

This must be continued and eventually the prime numbers can be spotted.
This method can be used for finding prime numbers in any range.
