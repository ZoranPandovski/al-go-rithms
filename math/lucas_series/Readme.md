#Lucas Series

The Lucas series/sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, which is when the next number is calculated by adding the two preceding numbers. The difference between the Fibonacci sequence and the Lucas sequence is that the Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1 instead of 0 and 1.

#Example

The first 10 Lucas numbers:
2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 75, 123
