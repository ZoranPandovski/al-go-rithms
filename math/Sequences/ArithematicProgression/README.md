# Arithematic Progression

In mathematics, an arithmetic progression or arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between the consecutive terms is constant.

The general form of an Arithmetic Progression is `a`, `a + d`, `a + 2d`, `a + 3d` and so on. Thus nth term of an AP series is `Tn = a + (n - 1) d`, where `Tn = nth term` and `a = first term`. Here `d = common difference = Tn - Tn-1`.
