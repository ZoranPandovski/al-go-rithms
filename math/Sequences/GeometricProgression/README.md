# Geometric Sequence

In mathematics, a geometric progression, also known as a geometric sequence, is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio.

We can write a formula for the `nth term` of a geometric sequence in the form. `an=arn` , where `r` is the common ratio between successive terms.
