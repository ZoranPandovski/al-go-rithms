# Sequence

A sequence is an ordered list of numbers. A series is the sum of the terms of a sequence. Usually, the terms are numbers. A sequence can have infinite terms.

There are different types of sequences such as Arithematic Sequence, Geometric Sequence etc.

> ## Arithematic Sequence

A sequence is group of numbers that follow a pattern based on a specific rule. An arithmetic sequence involves a sequence of numbers to which the same amount has been added or subtracted. The amount that is added or subtracted is known as the common difference. For example, in the sequence “1, 4, 7, 10, 13…” each number has been added to 3 in order to derive the succeeding number. The common difference for this sequence is 3.
