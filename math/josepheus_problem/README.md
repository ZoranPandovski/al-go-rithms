<h1>Josepheus Problem</h1>

the Josephus problem (or Josephus permutation) is a theoretical problem related to a certain counting-out game.

<h2> Description </h2>
  <p>People are standing in a circle waiting to be executed. Counting begins at a specified point in the circle and proceeds 
around the circle in a specified direction. After a specified number of people are skipped, the next person is executed.</p>
  <p>The procedure is repeated with the remaining people, starting with the next person, going in the same direction and 
  skipping the same number of people, until only one person remains, and is freed.</p>

<h2> The Problem </h2>
<p> Given the number of people and number to be skipped, the problem is to choose the position in the 
initial circle to avoid execution.</p>

<h3> Note </h3>
<p> This algorithm is considering the 0 as a initial position. Also implements the left-right direction. But don't worry, you 
can change it easily to attends to your needs! </p>
