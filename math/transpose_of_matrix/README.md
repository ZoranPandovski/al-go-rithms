## Transpose of matrix

In linear algebra, the transpose of a matrix is an operator which flips a matrix over its diagonal, that is it switches the row and column indices of the matrix by producing another matrix denoted as A<sup>T</sup> [1].

It is achieved by any one of the following equivalent actions:
- Reflect A over its main diagonal (which runs from top-left to bottom-right) to obtain A<sup>T</sup>.
- Write the rows of A as the columns of A<sup>T</sup>.
- Write the columns of A as the rows of A<sup>T</sup>.

Formally, the <i>i</i>-th row, <i>j</i>-th column element of A<sup>T</sup> is the <i>j</i>-th row, <i>i</i>-th column element of A:
