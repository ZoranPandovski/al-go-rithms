"""       MAGIC MATRIX

A nÃ—n square matrix of positive integers is called a magic square if the following sums are equal:

(1) row-sum : sum of numbers in every row; there are nn such values, one for each row

(2) column-sum : sum of numbers in every column; there are nn such values, one for each column

(3) diagonal-sum : sum of numbers in both the diagonals; there are two values
