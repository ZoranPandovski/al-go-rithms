# Linear Interpolation

In mathematics, linear interpolation is a method of curve fitting using linear polynomials to construct new data points within the range of a discrete set of known data points.

## Use cases

When creating charts or other graphical elements a developer has to map between two coordinate systems quite often: The pixels values of the monitor and the coordinates of the image/canvas. To map between those two worlds, linear interpolation can be used.
