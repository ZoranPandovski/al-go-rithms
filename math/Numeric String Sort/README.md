### Numeric String Sort

General String Sorting algorithms sort things alphabetically.
This means that Numbers too are sorted alphabetically.
Though it is the same if both numbers are of equal length, 
It leads to unnatural ordering if numbers are of different lengths.

By defining a function so that strings are sorted first by length, then by element, this can be easily reslved.
