Graph m-coloring problem
========================

Given an undirected graph and a number m, determine if the graph can be colored with at most m colors such that no two adjacent vertices of the graph are colored with same color. The coloring of a graph means assignment of colors to all vertices.

## An example graph that can be colored with 3 colors.
