## Generate all permutations of a string ##

Given a string with all distinct characters, the task is to 
generate all permutations of the string. For a n-letter string, there should 
be n! strings as output. For repeating characters, there are corresponding duplicates.

An example of the program:
Input: 
abc

Output:
1. abc
2. acb
3. bac
4. bca
5. cba
6. cab
