It is an updated problem of n - queen question of recursion.
The question is like to arrange eight queens on a chessboard in such a way that no two queens attack one another Each tile is either free or reserved, and you may only place queens on the free squares as an added difficulty. The restricted squares, on the other hand, do not prohibit queens from assaulting one other. How many possible ways are there to place the queens ?
