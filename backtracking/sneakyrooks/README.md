# Snealy Rooks problem #
As same as n-queen problem but this problem is about rooks 
and it can be used in infinite size of board

Like others backtracking problems, this can be solve put rooks in
positions that are not attacked until there is not option. So, we remove
the last rook from its position and put in another valid position.
