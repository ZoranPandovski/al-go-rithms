Given n wines in a row, with integers denoting the cost of each wine respectively. Each year you can sale the first or the last wine in the row. However, the price of wines increases over time.

For each year, your task is to print “beg” or “end” denoting whether first or last wine should be sold. Also, calculate the maximum profit from all the wines.
