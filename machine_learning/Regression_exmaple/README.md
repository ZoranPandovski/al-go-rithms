<center><h3>Regression</h3></center>

In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships among variables.
It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between a dependent 
variable and one or more independent variables (or 'predictors').
More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable  changes when any one of the 
independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed.

In terms of Machine learning, Regression helps us to predict the output variable from given inputs by learning from a sample of input-output
pairs (known as training dataset).
For ex. If we want to predict the price of a house , just by knowing its area we can let our regression model , learn the relationship between 
them. Here's a graph which gives us an idea of their relationship

Regression draws a line or curve( in polynomial regression) which fits the dataset best and based on this fit it predicts the outputs of unknown 
input data.

**Linear Regression**

 linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more 
 explanatory variables (or independent variables). Here our model draws a line.
 
 Here's how the linear regression model learns slowly and finds the best line fit for the data.
