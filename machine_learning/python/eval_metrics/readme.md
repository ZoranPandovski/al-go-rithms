## Performance Metrics

You must estimate the quality of a set of predictions when training a machine learning model. Performance metrics like classification accuracy and root mean squared error can give you a clear objective idea of how good a set of predictions is, and in turn how good the model is that generated them.

### This is important as it allows you to tell the difference and select among:
* Different transforms of the data used to train the same machine learning model.
* Different machine learning models trained on the same data.
* Different configurations for a machine learning model trained on the same data.

### As such, performance metrics are a required building block in implementing machine learning algorithms from scratch.
