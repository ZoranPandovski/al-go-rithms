# Supprt Vector Machine

The Supprt Vector Machine is one of the superivsed learning algorithm of machine learning that is 
used for both the classification and the regression problems. The main classification of the data 
points are done through by drawing the optimal hyperplane. But how would the hyperplane be determine
as the optimal one. Well this algorithm does this drawing the supporting vetors the categories in 
the dataset. And the main hyperplane would be consider the optimal one that has the wider area between 
supporting vector.
