# Machine Learning
It is a subset of a larger field Artificial Intelligence. Machine Learning is now the most succesful in all of AI.
It was present since 1950's but it's potential was never realised untill we got loads of data and powerful processors.
The combination of powerful processors and data have helped ML explode and conquer every company which has data.
Anyone who has lots of data would want to infer intelligence from the data they have. That can be done with the help of Machine Learning.

## Languages needed
Python and R are the most used languages in this field, and the language which is most used by developers have the most support.
Python and R both have a lot of libraries which have implemented all the famous algorithms that are developed.

### Libraries
Pandas is a library for managing datasets in python it is very widely used by researchers and engineers industry wide.
Numpy is a library for mathematical calculations which introduces the basic concepts used in every ML algorithm.
There are many more famous libraries which are used for Machine Learning ScikitLearn, SciPy, Tensorflow to name a few.

## Basic Programs
Simple Neural Networks and CNN can be implemented easily which are included in this directory. Iris flower Recognition program is considered to be the Hello World program for Machine Learning that is also included in this repository with different possible implementations listed
