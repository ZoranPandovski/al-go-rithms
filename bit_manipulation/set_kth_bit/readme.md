## Set the kth bit ##

Given non negative integers 'N' and 'k'. Set the kth bit from right in binary representation of 'N'. Display the result.

Example 1:
Input: 
5 1

Output:
7

Example 2:
Input: 
10 2

Output:
14

Explaination:
In first example, the binary representation of 5 is 101 and on setting the 1st bit from right (assuming zero based indexing), the binary representation becomes 111 i.e. 7.
