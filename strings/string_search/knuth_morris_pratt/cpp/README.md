## Problem Statement

Given two strings s and t (|s|<=|t|), find the starting index of all the occurences of s in t. 

## Constraints 

```
1 <= |s| <= |t| <= 100000
```

## Input:

First line of the input contains the string s.
Second line of the input contains the string t.

## Output: 

In new lines, output the starting index of occurences of s in t. 
Assume 0-based indexing. 

## Example

### Input:

```
xt
txtxtxtx
```

### Output:

```
1
3
5
```
