# Isogram
An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

# Anagram
An anagram of a string is another string that contains same characters, only the order of characters can be different. Implemented way uses two lists to store the count of every character in provided strings which will be used to determine whether provided strings are anagram or not.
