Frequent Pattern Mining -

Mining frequent items, itemsets, subsequences, or other substructures is usually among the first steps to analyze a large-scale dataset, which has been an active research topic in data mining for years. We refer users to Wikipedia’s association rule learning for more information. spark.mllib provides a parallel implementation of FP-growth, a popular algorithm to mining frequent itemsets.
FP-growth

The FP-growth algorithm is described in the paper Han et al., Mining frequent patterns without candidate generation, where “FP” stands for frequent pattern. Given a dataset of transactions, the first step of FP-growth is to calculate item frequencies and identify frequent items. Different from Apriori-like algorithms designed for the same purpose, the second step of FP-growth uses a suffix tree (FP-tree) structure to encode transactions without generating candidate sets explicitly, which are usually expensive to generate. After the second step, the frequent itemsets can be extracted from the FP-tree. In spark.mllib, we implemented a parallel version of FP-growth called PFP, as described in Li et al., PFP: Parallel FP-growth for query recommendation. PFP distributes the work of growing FP-trees based on the suffixes of transactions, and hence more scalable than a single-machine implementation. We refer users to the papers for more details.
