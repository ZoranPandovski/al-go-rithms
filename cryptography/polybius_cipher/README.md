### Polybius cipher

In cryptography, the Polybius square, also known as the Polybius checkerboard, is a device invented by the Ancient Greek historian and scholar Polybius, for fractionating plaintext characters so that they can be represented by a smaller set of symbols.

The Polybius Square is essentially identical to the simple substitution cipher, except that each plaintext character is enciphered as 2 ciphertext characters. It can ususally be detected if there are only 5 or 6 different characters in the ciphertext.

This algorithm offers very little communication security, and can be easily broken even by hand, especially as the messages become longer (more than several hundred ciphertext characters).
