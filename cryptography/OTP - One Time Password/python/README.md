# OTP - One Time Password

<h5>
//
    Authentication, the process of identifying and validating an individual is the rudimentary step before granting 
    access to any protected service (such as a personal account). Authentication has been built into the cyber security standards and offers to prevent unauthorized access to safeguarded resources. Authentication mechanisms today 
    create a double layer gateway prior to unlocking any protected information.<br>

    This double layer of security, termed as two factor authentication, creates a pathway that requires validation of credentials (username/email and password) followed by creation and validation of the One Time Password (OTP). 
    The OTP is a numeric code that is randomly and uniquely generated during each authentication event. This adds 
    an additional layer of security, as the password generated is fresh set of digits each time an authentication 
    is attempted and it offers the quality of being unpredictable for the next created session.
