### Caesar cipher

The Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher, is one of the simplest forms of encryption. It is a substitution cipher where each letter in the original message (called the plaintext) is replaced with a letter corresponding to a certain number of letters up or down in the alphabet. 
In this way, a message that initially was quite readable, ends up in a form that can not be understood at a simple glance.
