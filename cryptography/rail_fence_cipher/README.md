# Rail Fence Cipher
The railfence cipher is an easy to apply transposition cipher that jumbles up the order of the letters of a message in a quick convenient way. It also has the security of a key to make it a little bit harder to break.
The Rail Fence cipher works by writing your message on alternate lines across the page, and then reading off each line in turn. For example, the plaintext "defend the east wall" is written as shown below, with all spaces removed.
