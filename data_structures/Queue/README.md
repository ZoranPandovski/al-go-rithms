# Queues

A [Queue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_%28abstract_data_type%29) is a lot like the Stack data structure, but the order in which you pull elements out is different. In a Queue you `enqueue` to put something into the Queue and you `dequeue` to pull something out. In other words, this is a **first-in, first-out** data structure, aka FIFO.
