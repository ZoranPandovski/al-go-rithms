### Breadth first search

Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key'[1]) and explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbours.
