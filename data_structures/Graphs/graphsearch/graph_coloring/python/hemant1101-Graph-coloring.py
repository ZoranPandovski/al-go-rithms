"""
Graph coloring problem is to assign colors to certain elements of a graph subject 
to certain constraints. 
Vertex coloring is the most common graph coloring problem. The problem is, given m colors, 
find a way of coloring the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices are 
colored using same color. The other graph coloring problems like Edge Coloring (No vertex is 
incident to two edges of same color) and Face Coloring (Geographical Map Coloring) 
can be transformed into vertex coloring. 

To learn more about this algorithm you can follow up on GeeksforGeeks.
