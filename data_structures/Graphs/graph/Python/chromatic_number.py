##1. Color first vertex with first color.
##2. Do following for remaining V-1 vertices.
##â€¦.. a) Consider the currently picked vertex and color it with the
##lowest numbered color that has not been used on any previously
##colored vertices adjacent to it. If all previously used colors
##appear on vertices adjacent to v, assign a new color to it.
