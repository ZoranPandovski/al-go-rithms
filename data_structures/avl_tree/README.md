# AVL Tree
An avl tree is a specific type of binary search tree that automatically balances itself (and all of its subtrees). At any given moment, any given subtree height will differ at most by 1. Maintaining a balanced tree is beneficial because it allows a user to search for a value within it in O(log(n)) time.
The main components to implementing a binary search tree are determining balance factors and implementing proper rotations.
# Balance Factors
A balance factor is simple. Every node has one, and it indicates the difference in height between its two subtrees.  ![A balanced binary search tree](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/AVL-tree-wBalance_K.svg/262px-AVL-tree-wBalance_K.svg.png)

Note that even though this tree appears unbalanced, it is still considered balanced because every balance factor is 1, 0, or -1. As with many tree data structures, certain functions of it can be easily accomplished recursively. Determining a node's balance factor is one such function.
# Rotations
Once we have our balance factors, we use them to determine when a tree needs to be adjusted. Balancing happens as nodes are inserted or deleted, so every time the tree is changed rotations may happen. There are 4 cases for rotations:
1. Left Left: a given node has the BF (balance factor) -2 and its left child has BF -1. To balance, rotate clockwise around the node.
2. Right Right: a given node has the BF +2 and its right child has BF +1. To balance, rotate counter-clockwise around the node.
3. Left Right: a given node has a BF of -2 and its left child BF is +1. To balance, rotate left around child, then right around parent.
3. Right Left: a given node has a BF of +2 and its right child BF is -1. To balance, rotate right around child, then left around parent.

# Arrays
While it makes sense to define some simple struct or class to represent each node in the form 

    class TreeNode {
	    int data;
	    TreeNode left;
	    TreeNode right;
	}
where left and right are references to a node's children, it's worth mentioning that binary trees can be easily represented in arrays as pictured by the following:

any given node at index *i* has children at indices *2i+1* and *2i+2* (for a 0-indexed array).
