# B-Tree

B-tree is a tree with two or more child nodes. B-tree must satisfy three conditions. First, the root node must have at least two child nodes. Second, all nodes other than the root node and external nodes have at least [m/2] child nodes. Finally, all external nodes must be at the same level. 
There can be more than one data within a node, and the data must be sorted. In addition, values smaller than the node’s data must be in the left subtree and values larger than the node’s data must be in the right subtree.
