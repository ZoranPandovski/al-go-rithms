####2 Dimensional Arrays

Implementing a database of information as a collection of arrays can be inconvenient when we have to pass many arrays to utility functions to process the database. It would be nice to have a single data structure which can hold all the information, and pass it all at once.

2-dimensional arrays provide most of this capability. Like a 1D array, a 2D array is a collection of data cells, all of the same type, which can be given a single name. However, a 2D array is organized as a matrix with a number of rows and columns.
