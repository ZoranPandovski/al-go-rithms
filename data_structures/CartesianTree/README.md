# Cartesian tree
 A binary tree derived from a sequence of numbers; it can be uniquely defined from the properties 
that it is heap-ordered and that a symmetric (in-order) traversal of the tree returns the 
original sequence. Introduced by Vuillemin (1980) in the context of geometric range searching
data structures, Cartesian trees have also been used in the definition of the treap and
randomized binary search tree data structures for binary search problems. The Cartesian tree for
a sequence may be constructed in linear time using a stack-based algorithm for finding all 
nearest smaller values in a sequence.
