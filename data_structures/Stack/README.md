# Stacks

A stack is a special data structure where you only add, access, and remove elements from the top.  A stack is also known as a last-in first-out (LIFO) structure. The **Last** thing to be added **In** to a stack is the **First** thing that comes **Out** of it.

In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations:

- push, which adds an element to the collection, and
- pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (last in, first out). Additionally, a peek operation may give access to the top without modifying the stack.
The ADT operations on stack are:
1. push-inserts an element at top of stack.
2. pop-deletes one element from top of stack.
3. Top -gives top element of stack.
4. IsEmpty-whether stack is empty or not.
