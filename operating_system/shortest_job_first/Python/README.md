<h1>SJF (Shortest Job First) Scheduling Algorithm</h1>

<h5>
    Shortest Job First (SJF) is an algorithm in which the process having the smallest execution time is chosen for 
    the next execution. This scheduling method can be preemptive or non-preemptive. It significantly reduces the 
    average waiting time for other processes awaiting execution. The full form of SJF is Shortest Job First.

<h4> Characteristics of SJF Scheduling Algorithm </h4>

<h5>
        1. It is associated with each job as a unit of time to complete.
  <br>  2. This algorithm method is helpful for batch-type processing, where waiting for jobs to complete is not 
            critical.
  <br>  3. It can improve process throughput by making sure that shorter jobs are executed first, hence possibly have 
          a short turnaround time.
  <br>  4. It improves job output by offering shorter jobs, which should be executed first, which mostly have a shorter          
          turnaround time.
