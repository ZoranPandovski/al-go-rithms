<h1>FCFS (First Come First Serve) Scheduling Algorithm</h1>

<h5>
    First Come First Serve (FCFS) is an operating system scheduling algorithm that automatically executes queued 
    requests and processes in order of their arrival. It is the easiest and simplest CPU scheduling algorithm. In this
    type of algorithm, processes which requests the CPU first get the CPU allocation first. This is managed with a 
    FIFO queue.

<h4> Characteristics of FCFS Scheduling Algorithm </h4>

<h5>
        1. It supports non-preemptive and pre-emptive scheduling algorithm.
  <br>  2. Jobs are always executed on a first-come, first-serve basis.
  <br>  3. It is easy to implement and use.
  <br>  4. This method is poor in performance, and the general wait time is quite high.
