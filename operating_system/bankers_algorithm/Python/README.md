<h1>Banker's Algorithm</h1>

<h5>
    The banker’s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by 
    simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes an “s-state” 
    check to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

<h4> Characteristics of Banker's Algorithm </h4>

<h5>
    Here are important characteristics of banker's algorithm: <br>

  <br>  1. Keep many resources that satisfy the requirement of at least one client
  <br>  2. Whenever a process gets all its resources, it needs to return them in a restricted period.
  <br>  3. When a process requests a resource, it needs to wait
  <br>  4. The system has a limited number of resources
  <br>  5. Advance feature for max resource allocation
