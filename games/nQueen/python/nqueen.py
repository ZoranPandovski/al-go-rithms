# The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. 
# Queen can move in verticaly, horizontaly and dialgonaly in chess. This problem is solved using depth first search 
# and backtracking.The logic is to place queens one by one in different columns, starting from leftmost column. 
# When the queen is placed, check if it satisfies all the conditions. 
# If it satisfies then go ahead otherwise backtrack to the previous step. Do these steps until we get to last 
# column to get the answer.


# Time Complexity:
# when we assign a location of the queen in the first column, we have n options, 
# after that, we only have n-1 options as we can't place the queen in the same row as the first queen,
# then n-2 and so on. Thus, the worst-case complexity is still upper bounded by O(n!).The time complexity will be O(N!)


# Space Complexity:
# As the program only uses a board which is given by default. So the space complexity of program will be O(1).
