### Counting Sort

Counting Sort is an algorithm for sorting a collection of objects according to keys that are small integers; it is an integer sorting algorithm.

It operates by counting the number of objects that have each distinct key value, and using arithmetic on those counts to determine the positions of each key value in the output sequence.

Its running time is linear in the number of items and the difference between the maximum and minimum key values, so it is only suitable for direct use in situations where the variation in keys is not significantly greater than the number of items. However, it is often used as a subroutine in another sorting algorithm, radix sort, that can handle larger keys more efficiently.

Because counting sort uses key values as indexes into an array, it is not a comparison sort, and the Î©(n log n) lower bound for comparison sorting does not apply to it. Bucket sort may be used for many of the same tasks as count sort, with a similar time analysis; however, compared to count sort, bucket sort requires linked lists, dynamic arrays or a large amount of preallocated memory to hold the sets of items within each bucket, whereas counting sort instead stores a single number (the count of items) per bucket.
