### Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
One way to think of Bubble sort is that with each iteration completed, the biggest number "bubbles" to the end of the list.
Bubble sort is a stable sort means if two objects with equal keys appear in same order in sorted output as they appear in input unsorted array.
Insertion sort,Merge Sort,Counting Sort are also stable sort algorithms.

Fun fact:
Former President Obama mentioned Bubble Sort in an intewview at Google (link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koMpGeZpu4Q&ab_channel=DanSiroker)
