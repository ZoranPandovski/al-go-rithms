//Returns the sorted vector after performing SlowSort
//It is a sorting algorithm that is of humorous nature and not useful. 
//It's based on the principle of multiply and surrender, a tongue-in-cheek joke of divide and conquer. 
//It was published in 1986 by Andrei Broder and Jorge Stolfi in their paper Pessimal Algorithms and Simplexity Analysis.
//This algorithm multiplies a single problem into multiple subproblems
//It is interesting because it is provably the least efficient sorting algorithm that can be built asymptotically, 
//and with the restriction that such an algorithm, while being slow, must still all the time be working towards a result.
