# Hybrid Sorting Algorithm
This project makes a hybrid sorting algorithm combining merge sort and insertion sort algorithm, to boost the performance of merge sort algorithm.

## What is Hybrid Sorting Algorithm?

How can we make the mergesort algorithm have better performance? One of the possible solutions is a hybrid sorting algorithm which combines the mergesort with insertion sorting algorithm. The hybrid sorting algorithm begins with the mergesort and switches to the insertion sorting algorithm when the size of subarray is equal to 'number' (The size of the last subarray can be less than 'number'). This algorithm takes the advantages of both algorithms achieving practical performance on typical data sets. Especially, the hybrid sorting algorithm is better performance than the basic mergesort in the best case.
