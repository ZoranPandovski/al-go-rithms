Merge sort is an efficient divide and conquer algorithm. This sort creates a stable sort which means that the equals elemnts will be in the same order for the input and output.
This algorithm works by dividing the elements up until there is only one element left and then it will keep oon merging the sublists until you will get your final sorted list.
This algorithm is a little long but it is very fast, effective, and reliable so it is worth remembering it for things like coding challenges on leetcode.
