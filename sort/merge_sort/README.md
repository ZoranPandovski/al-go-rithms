### Merge sort

Merge sort is a "divide and conquer" sorting element that recursively splits the input into two halves, sorts them, and then combines the two arrays. It is widely used for its efficiency and simple implementation. 

The worst-case and average complexities are both O(_n_ log _n_), making it one of the most efficient sorting algorithms. It is also one of the more efficient for sorting linked lists.
