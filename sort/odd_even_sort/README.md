In computing, an odd–even sort or odd–even transposition sort (also known as brick sort[1][self-published source]) is a relatively simple 
sorting algorithm,developed originally for use on parallel processors with local interconnections. 
It is a comparison sort related to bubble sort, with which it shares many characteristics. 
It functions by comparing all odd/even indexed pairs of adjacent elements in the list and, 
if a pair is in the wrong order (the first is larger than the second) the elements are switched. 
The next step repeats this for even/odd indexed pairs (of adjacent elements). 
Then it alternates between odd/even and even/odd steps until the list is sorted.
