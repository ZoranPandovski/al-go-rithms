# Tries
Tries are also known as prefix trees or radix trees. Using this data structure, we can efficiently retrieve the stored keys. If the maximum length of the strings stored in the tries is N, then the time taken to retrieve any string is O(N).
In a trie, each node represents a string which is a prefix of it's children and the root node is an empty string. The children of a node are the possible next characters from that node.
