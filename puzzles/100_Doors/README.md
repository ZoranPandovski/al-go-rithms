# 100 Doors
### Problem Statement:
There are 100 doors in a row, all doors are initially closed. A person walks through all doors multiple times and toggle (if open then close, if close then open) them in following way:

     In first walk, the person toggles every door
   
     In second walk, the person toggles every second door, i.e., 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, ...
   
     In third walk, the person toggles every third door, i.e. 3rd, 6th, 9th, ...
     
     ...
     
     ...
     
     ...
     
     In 100th walk, the person toggles 100th door.

**Which doors are open in the end?**
