/*   The problem statement is :
	 We are given n pots of candies and each pot contain some candy in it and we have to distribute candies among k children such that
	 => all the children should get equal number of candies
	 => each child should get maximum possible candies 
	 => one child cannot get candies form more than one pot (use only one pot for one child)
	 
	 Example: 
	 	Let there are 4 pots and candies corresponding to each pot is 3,2,3,9 and the number of children is 2 then we can distribute maximum of 4 candies
		to each child.
		
		Explanation: We distributed 4-4 candoes from the pot containing 9 candies as we can only use one pot for one child, so the maximum possible is 4. 
	
	 Input:  first line n and k (number of pots and candies correspinding to each pot)
	 		 second line n space separated integers representing number of candies in each pot
	 Output: maximum possible candies each child can get.
