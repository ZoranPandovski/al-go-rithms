# Anagram

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. Any word or phrase that exactly reproduces the letters in another order is an anagram. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram)
