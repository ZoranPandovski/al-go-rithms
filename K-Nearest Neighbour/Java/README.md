# About the algorithm

[I](https://github.com/Darkkgreen) have made this algorithm a while ago when I was studying classification and I didn't changed anything in it. Feel free to improve.

# Usage

You have to change the file location to read the tests (already made classifications) in the Main file. The algorithm is working for the examples I uploaded with it but you can modify the object and those functions to work with other examples.
