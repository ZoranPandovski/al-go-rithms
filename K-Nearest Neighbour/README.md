## K-Nearest Neighbors
K-Nearest neighbor is machine learning algorithm that can used for classification and regression.
In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression:
 * In k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.
 * In k-NN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of its k nearest neighbors.
