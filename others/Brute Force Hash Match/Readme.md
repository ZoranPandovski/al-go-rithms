# Brute Force Hash Matching


We set difficulty in range 0-100, and wait to identify the time taken to solve find SHA256 hash with that percentage of 0s in the beginning.
The task may seem trivial, but requires a lot of computation.This is typically what bitcoin miners do, just in a more complicated condition.
