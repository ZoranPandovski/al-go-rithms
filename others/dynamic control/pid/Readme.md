PID algorithm is a Control System based dynamic control algorithm.
In simpler terms it can be described as a dynamic error calculation
and correction algorithm/

Majorly used in wheeled robotic locomotion to follow and maintain 
locomotion along a straight guideline usually drawn on the floor.

The code here is a very basic implementation of the PID algorithm.
A very good algorithm for robotics enthusiasts struggling with robotic
locomotion.
