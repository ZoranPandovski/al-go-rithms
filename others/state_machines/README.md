# State Machines

Sometimes referred to as "finite state automata", a state machine is a machine or program that runs with no memory by existing in one of a set number of states at any given moment. While this is technically unachievable using any conventional programming language, the concept can be layed out through any number of algorithms written in any given language.

* Add a folder with the language you are using and its appropriate files.
* I based the Java machine off of the coin machine example in the YouTube video below, but please be creative! Practical applications are fun!
