/**
 * Imagine a machine that gives you a quarter once you put in 25 cents. I suppose if you really like

 * then it will spit out a quarter. The machine is totally oblivious to what coins were added to reach
 * its current state, all it knows is the state it is in, which is how it achieves the "no memory" standard.
