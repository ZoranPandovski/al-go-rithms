Priority scheduling is a non-preemptive algorithm and one of the most common scheduling algorithms in batch systems. <br>
Each process is assigned a priority. Process with the highest priority is to be executed first and so on. <br>
Processes with the same priority are executed on first come first served basis. <br>
Priority can be decided based on memory requirements, time requirements or any other resource requirement.<br>
