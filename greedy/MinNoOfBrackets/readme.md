Problem

You are given a string of 2N characters consisting of N ‘[‘ brackets and N ‘]’ brackets. A string is considered balanced if it can be represented in the for S2[S1] where S1 and S2 are balanced strings. We can make an unbalanced string balanced by swapping adjacent characters. Calculate the minimum number of swaps necessary to make a string balanced.

Solution

We can initially go through the string and store the positions of ‘[‘ in a vector say ‘pos‘. Initialize ‘p’ to 0. We shall use p to traverse the vector ‘pos’. Similar to the naive approach, we maintain a count of encountered ‘[‘ brackets. When we encounter a ‘[‘ we increase the count, and increase ‘p’ by 1. When we encounter a ‘]’ we decrease the count. If the count ever goes negative, this means we must start swapping. The element pos[p] tells us the index of the next ‘[‘. We increase the sum by pos[p] – i, where i is the current index. We can swap the elements in the current index and pos[p] and reset count to 0.

Since we have converted a step that was O(N) in the naive approach, to an O(1) step, our new time complexity reduces.
Time Complexity = O(N)
Extra Space = O(N)
