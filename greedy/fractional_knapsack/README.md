Problem : 

Given weights and values of n items, we need put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. In the 0-1 Knapsack problem, we are not allowed to break items. We either take the whole item or donâ€™t take it. In Fractional Knapsack, we can break items for maximizing the total value of knapsack.
