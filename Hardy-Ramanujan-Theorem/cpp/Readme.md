# Hardy Ramanujam theorem 


This theorem states that the number of prime factors of n will approximately be log(log(n)) for most natural numbers n.

Example:

- 5192 has 2 distinct prime factors and log(log(5192)) = 2.1615
- 51242183 has 3 distinct prime facts and log(log(51242183)) = 2.8765

As the statement quotes, it is only an approximation. There are counter examples such as:

- 510510 has 7 distinct prime factors but log(log(510510)) = 2.5759
- 1048576 has 1 prime factor but log(log(1048576)) = 2.62922

This theorem is mainly used in approximation algorithms and its proof lead to bigger concepts in probability theory.
