Description
We define the following:

A subarray of array a of length n is a contiguous segment from a[i] through a[j] where 0<i<j<n.
The sum of an array is the sum of its elements.
Given an n element array of integers,a , and an integer, m, determine the maximum value of the sum of any of its subarrays modulo m.
