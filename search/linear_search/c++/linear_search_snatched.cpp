
// LINEAR SEARCH - Tutorial

/* Linear search is the most basic search algorithm you can think of.
It progressively checks for the searched element in each position of the array searched
and stops when the element contained in the current position examined is equal to the 
searched element. 

This type of search is applicable to any kind of data storage like lists and structures.

Consider n to be the number of comparisons needed to find the target. 
The cost of this search algorithm is an O(n) in the worst case scenario.
If the element to be searched for is the first element of the list then the
cost is a O(1) (equal to an if-then-else operation).

This means that for very large data structures a linear search algorithm can be faster than, 
for example, which has a cost of O(log n) and thus of lower performance when n is high provided
the elements are sorted in order of most likelihood to be searched.

// In this example!

/* This example shows a very simple implementatio of a linear search algorithm to search for
a target element of datatype integer in a standard vector of integers. This example is easily modifiable by
the reader to produce examples using different datatypes and data structures more complex than simple
vectors. */
