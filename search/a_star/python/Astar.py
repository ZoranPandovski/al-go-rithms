#In computer science, A* (pronounced as "A star") is a computer algorithm that is widely used in pathfinding and graph
# traversal, which is the process of finding a path between multiple points, called "nodes". It enjoys widespread use due 
#to its performance and accuracy. However, in practical travel-routing systems, it is generally outperformed by algorithms
# which can pre-process the graph to attain better performance,  although other work has found A* to be superior to other 
#approaches. 

#This algorithm is widely used in the field game development to approximate the shortest path on a map
#It is similar to Dijkstra’s Algorithm in the sense that the main objective of both algorithms is to find the shortest path
#       but it runs much quicker than Dijkstra’s Algorithm
