### A* Algorithm 

A* (A-star) algorithm is one of Graph Traversal algorithm which identifies the shortest path.

It is similar with Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, but A* achieves better performance by using heuristics to guide its search. 

Heuristic estimates the best path through each vertex. 

At each iteration of its loop, A* determine which of its paths to extend. 
A* selects the path that minimizes f(n) = g(n)+h(n). g(n) is cost of the path from the start node to nth node, and h(n) is cost of the path from nth node to the last node.

#### An example of A* algorithm

Nodes are cities, which are connected with roads(edges) and h(n) is the straight-line distance to target point in this example. Orange node between A and D is start, and blue node between C, E is the goal. 

Following is the problem-solving process.
