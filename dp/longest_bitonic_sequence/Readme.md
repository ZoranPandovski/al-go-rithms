#Longest Bitonic Subsequence

A subsequence of arr[] is called Bitonic if it is first increasing, then decreasing.The task here finds the longest bitonic subsequence within an array of integers.

Input arr[] = {1, 11, 2, 10, 4, 5, 2, 1};
Output: 6 (A Longest Bitonic Subsequence of length 6 is 1, 2, 10, 4, 2, 1)

Input arr[] = {12, 11, 40, 5, 3, 1}
Output: 5 (A Longest Bitonic Subsequence of length 5 is 12, 11, 5, 3, 1)

Input arr[] = {80, 60, 30, 40, 20, 10}
Output: 5 (A Longest Bitonic Subsequence of length 5 is 80, 60, 30, 20, 10)
