Consider a list of n ordered pairs of integers. These records need to be arranged in a binary search tree according to the key value of the first coordinate. The specific structure of the tree needs to be determined by you, such that the sum of the product of the depth of each node together with the second coordinate of that node is minimized. For simplicity, you may assume no duplication of values among the first coordinates. This problem should be solved using dynamic programming.
