# Count Balanced Binary Tree of Height h

Given a height h, count and return the maximum number of balanced binary trees possible with height h. A balanced binary tree is one in which for every 
node, the difference between heights of left and right subtree is not more than 1.

## Sample Test Cases
### Input 1 : h = 3
### Output 1 : 15

### Input 2 : h = 4
### Output 2 : 315
