1.Implement the algorithm for the rod cutting problem discussed in the lecture. The input consists of an input positive integer corresponding to the length of the rod and an array of positive integers of size n corresponding to the selling prices of each integer length of the rod from 1 to n. You need to write code to find the highest total selling price and also how the rod needs to be cut to achieve this selling price.

2.If we now modify the question and want to figure out if there is a way of achieving a total selling price of exactly P, instead of maximizing the selling price. Devise an algorithm to achieve this. If required you may sell only some part of the rod and store away the rest. The algorithm should output a configuration that achieves exactly P, if it is possible and otherwise should declare that no such possibility exists.
