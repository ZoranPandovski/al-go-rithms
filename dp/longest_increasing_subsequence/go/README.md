## Golang Implementation
 ---

The implementation will accept input of any type of numeric value (float, int16, int32, int64), but will output only as float64. The implementation is currently accepting input via stdin.

It is also worth noting that the implementation will output the subsequence with the lowest lexicographic order

To run the program, perform the following steps:
1. Install Go. Follow the system specific guides here [Download Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
2. Run `go run lis.go` for a quick use of the script. To build an executable, run `go build lis.go`
3. Follow the step onscreen.
