# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a problem-solving technique best suited for problems
that can be broken down into smaller recursive subproblems whose answers are
frequently needed in computing the overall problem. After solving a subproblem,
the result is stored and then used in the larger overarching problem to build
an overall solution. This technique may save a lot of time compared to a
traditionally recursive approach, because the answers to subproblems can just
be looked up instead of computed again. The process of storing and looking up
the subproblem solutions is called "memoization."
